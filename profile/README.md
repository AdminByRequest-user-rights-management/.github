## What is AdminByRequest?

**AdminByRequest** is an advanced user rights management solution designed to provide controlled administrator privileges in enterprise environments. Unlike traditional full admin rights that pose security risks, AdminByRequest allows temporary elevation of privileges based on approval workflows, ensuring security while maintaining productivity.

With AdminByRequest, organizations can enjoy:
- Controlled temporary admin rights for standard users
- Automated approval workflows for privilege elevation
- Comprehensive audit trails of all privilege escalations
- Application control and installation management

The solution supports Windows environments and is particularly valuable for companies managing large numbers of users who occasionally require administrative access. By implementing just-in-time administrator privileges, it ensures that security policies are maintained without hindering necessary operational activities.

Its enterprise-ready architecture and scalable deployment options make AdminByRequest a trusted choice for IT administrators and security professionals. Whether you're managing a small business network or a large corporate infrastructure, this solution provides granular control over user privileges.
